Dragons &amp; Soldiers Console Game
A game that has a board (created by the user, NxN)
There are two Teams: Blue & Red.

Red Players(Dragons and Soldiers) go from first row to last row  ⏬
Blue Players(Dragons and Soldiers) go from last row to first row ⏫

The Soldiers can move 1 time each step, 
The Dragons can move 4 times each step (forwards + left or right + forwards)

The game ends when when one of the Soldiers are reaching the starting row of the other team.

(Each team needs to define their own Dragons & Soldiers, and taking in care that they must put them in the first two rows of each team).

Red: first two lines. 
Blue: last two lines.
